Dfind Consulting In-House AI Solution

# Introduction
Dfind Consulting aims to build an in-house AI solution to improve
efficiency, streamline internal processes, and optimize sales and
recruitment. This AI will integrate seamlessly with Recman
(Randstad's HR system), Slack, and the company's CV database to
automate tasks, provide workforce insights, and support strategic
decision-making.

# Functional Requirements

## 1. Automating Mundane Tasks
The AI will reduce repetitive administrative tasks, allowing employees
to focus on high-value work. Key functionalities include:
- Automatically generating vacation applications via Slack
  commands, integrating with Recman.
- Handling sick leave and other absences seamlessly by interfacing
  with HR systems.

## 2. Workforce Insights for Sales and Recruitment
- AI-powered candidate matching for projects and job positions based
  on CV database integration.
- Real-time insights into available expertise and workforce allocation.

## 3. Sales and Professional Development Assistance
- Identifying in-demand skills by analyzing job postings and customer
  requests.
- Recommending training and upskilling initiatives to align with
  market trends.

# Technical Architecture

## Proposed Tech Stack
- **LLM:** DeepSeek LLM (model size depends on available GPU
  resources).
- **Runtime:** WSAM (WASM-based execution environment).
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes cluster to manage DeepSeek
  instances.
- **Agent Framework:** A robust AI agent framework supporting
  Java/Kotlin for better company-wide adoption.
- **Chat interface for DeepSeek:** An open-source Chat UI solution for DeepSeek.   

# Infrastructure Setup

## 1. Hardware Requirements
- Self-hosted Ubuntu gaming machines with high-performance NVIDIA
  GPUs.
- Kubernetes cluster for managing AI workloads.

## 2. Software Components
- **MicroK8s for Kubernetes cluster management.**
- **WSAM runtime for WebAssembly-based AI execution.**
- **AI agent framework for seamless task orchestration and
  integrations.**
